## Project Name:
Shopping Trends Data Analysis - Codtech Task 1

## Objectives:
1. Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a shopping trends dataset.
2. Uncover patterns, correlations, and outliers within the data to gain insights into customer behavior.
3. Visualize key trends to inform potential business strategies and marketing efforts.

## Key Activities:
1. Data Loading and Cleaning:
    a. Imported the dataset using pandas and checked for missing values.
    b. Encoded categorical variables and handled outliers.
2. Data Exploration:
    a. Conducted EDA to examine the distribution of key variables like age, purchase amounts, and review ratings.
    b. Calculated summary statistics to understand the dataset's structure.
3. Visualizations:
    a. Created visualizations such as histograms, scatter plots, and box plots to explore distributions and relationships.
    b. Plotted heatmaps to understand correlations between numerical variables.
4. Analysis and Interpretation:
    a. Analyzed customer behavior in terms of spending, age, and purchase history.
    b. Identified outliers and trends in the data that could influence business decisions.

## Technology Used:
1. Python: For all data manipulation and analysis.
2. pandas: For data loading, cleaning, and handling missing values.
3. numpy: For numerical operations and handling data.
4. seaborn and matplotlib: For data visualization (histograms, scatter plots, box plots, and heatmaps).

## Key Insights:
1. Purchase Behavior: Most purchases were low in value, with a few high-value outliers, indicating a skewed distribution.
2. Weak Correlation: There is no strong relationship between age and purchase amounts or between previous purchases and spending.
3. Outliers: Significant outliers in purchase behavior were found, indicating customers who make exceptionally high or low purchases.

## Conclusion:
This project explored shopping trends by performing EDA using Python's data analysis libraries. Through various visualizations, it was found that while most customers make low-value purchases, there are distinct outliers that could represent potential high-value customers. These insights can help businesses better understand their customer segments and guide targeted marketing strategies.
